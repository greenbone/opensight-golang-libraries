```go
func Logging() gin.HandlerFunc
```

Logging returns a Gin ginMiddleware handler that injects structured logging using zerolog into the request lifecycle. It ensures each request is assigned a correlation ID, which is included in both the request context and the response headers.

This is useful for tracing and debugging distributed systems, where tracking requests across services is critical.
