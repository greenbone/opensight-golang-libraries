# secretfiles

```go
import "github.com/greenbone/opensight-golang-libraries/pkg/secretfiles"
```

Package secretfiles eases the parsing of secret files into a string. This is a common scenario when working with docker secrets, where the path to the secret is usually stored in an environment variable \<SECRET\>\_FILE containing a path to a secret stored in the container filesystem.

## Index

- [func ReadSecret\(envVar string, target \*string\) error](<#ReadSecret>)


<a name="ReadSecret"></a>
## func [ReadSecret](<https://github.com/greenbone/opensight-golang-libraries/blob/main/pkg/secretfiles/secret_files.go#L21>)

```go
func ReadSecret(envVar string, target *string) error
```

ReadSecret reads the file path from the given environment variable and writes the content of this file into the target. Surrounding whitespaces are truncated.
